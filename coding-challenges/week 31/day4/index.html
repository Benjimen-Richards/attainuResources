    <p class="collapsible">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
        industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
        galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
        also
        the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
        the
        release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
