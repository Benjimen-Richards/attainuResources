Q:Elaborate and explain with a diagram difference between processes and threads?
ans:
PROCESS:->A process is an active program i.e. a program that is under execution. 
	It is more than the program code as it includes the program counter, process stack, registers, program code etc. 
	Compared to this, the program code is only the text section.

THREAD:->A thread is a lightweight process that can be managed independently by a scheduler.
	It improves the application performance using parallelism. A thread shares information like data segment, code segment, files etc.
	with its peer threads while it contains its own registers, stack, counter etc.


SOME KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PROCESS AND THREAD ARE:
1:Process being a heavyweight process so it takes more time to execute as compared to thread

2:Processes are totally independent and donâ€™t share memory whereas thread is not.

3:Thread blocks all its execution when one of its sequence is blocked.whereas process is not.

4:process needs more resources than threads whereas thread needs less resources.

5:Process needs more time for termination than thread
