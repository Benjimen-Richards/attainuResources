Q1. What is the time complexity of the following code :
a = 0, i = N
while i > 0:
a += i
i /= 2
Q2 What is the time complexity of the following code
i = n / 2
 while i < n:
 j = 2
 while j < n:
 j *= 2
Q3.
 count = 0;
 i = N
 while i > 0:
 While j < i:
 count+=1
 i /= 2
SOLUTION
1 . logn
2. Nlogn
3. O(N)
